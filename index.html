          <p>I gave a special lecture to 1st & 2nd years high-school students at my alma mater in Fukuoka! I had decided to talk about emergent quasiparticles in 2D vdW heterostructures and seeing them with THz light, which I was afraid of whether it is too much for them-- It was an unnecessary worry! They are so brilliant and catch the concept quickly; one student even asked what would be the design principle for realizing 2D emergent phenomena...! As last year, I truly enjoyed interacting and discussing with them so^2 much!

          <p>[Virtual gain!] Collaboration work posted to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18224" target="_blank">arXiv</a>! Led by the Basov and Alù groups, this work reports the experimental observation of the very exciting theoretical idea of virtual gain (more generally, non-Hermitian wave physics) by exploiting a polaritonic system and space-time metrology. By matching the frequency-domain impedance between the excitation and target waves through pulse shaping, one can control the target wave dynamics spatiotemporally, such as making the wave travel farther in space than it usually does. I appreciate I could have this opportunity to learn this exciting physics and photonics!

          <p>Our work on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02201-1" target="_blank">vdW THz emitter</a> was featured in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02265-z" target="_blank">News & Views</a> of Nature Materials! This short article begins by introducing collective electronic motion as the heart of quantum coherence/phenomena and then discusses the critical importance of THz spectroscopy in studying these quantum behaviors. It then introduces how our new approach could overcome existing difficulties in applying THz spectroscopy to vdW quantum materials. I myself enjoyed reading their views very much; check out this article <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02265-z" target="_blank">"A terahertz source for quantum physics"</a>!

          <p>[Ferron!] Our latest work was posted to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22559" target="_blank">arXiv</a>! We report the experimental observation of coherent ferrons, a quasiparticle that arises from collective excitation of ferroelectric order, in 2D NbOI2 (I was very fortunate for this observation, as I’ll explain on the Research page soon). Ferron polarization wave propagates very quickly due to the long-range dipolar interaction. Ferrons can be conceptually viewed as a ferroelectric counterpart of magnons. One could envisage “ferronics” as like magnonics, while their fundamental differences may enable distinct functions and quantum technologies, such as the direct coupling of ferrons to light and electric dipoles. More works will appear soon (hopefully), and thanks a lot to this great collaboration at Columbia!

We report the observation of very efficient and broadband THz radiation from 2D vdW ferroelectric NbOI2 and apply it for on-chip near-field THz spectroscopy. I hope this "vdW assembly approach" will help studies of THz responses and low-energy landscapes of various vdW materials, devices, and micrometer-sized quantum materials. Also, very glad that we could learn more deeply about this exciting material. Huge thanks to the close collaboration with the Roy and McIver groups at Columbia🙏

We discovered a 2D van der Waals THz emitter with giant THz radiation efficiency and broad bandwidth. Due to the vdW nature, one can prepare an ultrathin THz emitter and assemble it with a target vdW material/heterostructure. We demonstrate in situ near-field THz spectroscopy on vdW heterostructure using this approach. This study was made possible by the close collaboration with the Roy and McIver labs at Columbia!

          <p>I gave an online class to freshmen at Meizen High School, Japan (my alma mater, actually!), which was so much fun! While the class was on my current research projects, I had various sharp questions and comments, which made me feel like I was in the Q&A session of a conference talk. It's always fun and inspiring to talk with people with fresh minds and very fundamental questions!</p>

          <p>Our paper studying the quasiparticles in photoexcited TMDC monolayers with THz spectroscopy has been published in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.adj4060" target="_blank">Sci. Adv.</a>! Due to their ultimately thin nature and consequent very large exciton binding energies, photoexcitation of TMDCs has been considered to result in the formation of charge-neutral excitons. Our work reveals the presence of large number of free charge carriers and its relation to defect states. 
One of the most fascinating aspects of this project is the ability to study the properties of atomically thin materials, thinner than a nanometer, using far-field THz waves with wavelengths on the order of a millimeter. This comprehensive work was made possible through exceptional collaboration with groups at Columbia and Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research. I deeply appreciate this collaboration!

		  We experimentally and theoretically studied optical responses and electronic structures of 2D superatomic solid made of atomically-precise [Re6Se8] clusters. We observe linearly polarized PL emissions whose direction strongly depends on the temperature. The two distinct directions of PL emissions observed at low and high temperatures correspond, respectively, to the asymmetric inter-cluster bonding directions within the 2D plane. With DFT and TDDFT, we discuss the microscopic origins of the observations and, more broadly, how the electronic structure of individual clusters evolves when they are fused together. Together with the findings on the C60-based superatomic solid, these results point to the possibility of strategic hierarchal design of superatomic solid with targeted properties.

		Collaborative work at Columbia (led by the Roy group) was published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05401-w" target="_blank">Nature</a>, reporting the synthesis and evaluation of materials properties of graphullerene, a two-dimensional crystalline polymer of C60! We, the XYZ group, contributed to far-field visible spectroscopic studies. Spectroscopic findings include a brightening of excitons in graphullerene (compared to individual C60 clusters) due to the interlcuster-bonding-induced change in band-edge electornic structure, the observation of PL down to bilayer, and polarizaed PL emission reflecting the assymetric intercluser bonding within the 2D plane.

		   In photovoltaic research, the determination of charge carrier lifetime using pulse-excitation time-resolved techniques constitutes invaluable means for evaluating material properties toward photovoltaic application.
		  Despite its wide use, there has yet been concise discussion on how one can relate the lifetime determined by pulse-excitation measurements to the steady-state carrier lifetime and density that will be realized under cw excitation (actual operation condition).
		  We propose in this paper a simple analysis procedure that enables predicting the steady-state carrier properties and thus relevant photovoltaic performance in a solar cell under cw 1-sun excitation based on pulse-excitation measurements.
		  This would help directly bridge the fundamental understanding of material property and actual device performance!

		  極限的な薄さに由来した巨大な励起子束縛エネルギーにより励起子が支配的な準粒子と考えられてきましたが、かなりの数の自由電荷も存在することが分かりました。厚さがナノメートル（10^-9）しかない物質の性質をミリメートル（10^-3）オーダーの長波長電磁波で調べられる点が個人的に面白いです。たくさんのチームとの共同研究により可能になりました、感謝です。

[Re6Se8]という、構成原子数や構造が原子レベルで精密な多原子クラスターを一つの人工的な原子（超原子）とみなして、それらを共有結合でくっつけた2次元性固体の光学特性を実験と理論で詳しく調べた論文です。2次元面内のx方向とy方向で超原子間の結合様式が大きく異なっており強い面内構造異方性が存在します。その結果、超原子固体は直線偏光した発光を示し、さらにその偏光方向が温度に強く依存することが分かりました（室温と低温で偏光方向が90°変化）。室温・低温での発光偏光の方向はそれぞれ、面内の異方的な結合の方向と対応しており、そのメカニズムをDFTとTDDFTから議論しました。C60の論文とともに、超原子固体の光学応答は構成要素のクラスターの孤立時の分子軌道および共有結合で誘起される電子状態の変化からおおよそ説明することができました。これらの結果は、ある所望の物性を持つ新物質をボトムアップ方式で階層的に設計・実現したい際の良い指針になってくれると考えています。

		  太陽電池研究分野において、パルス励起時間分解測定によるキャリア寿命の決定は極めて重要な物性評価手法の一つとなっています。
		  しかし、パルス励起実験により得られるキャリア寿命が、実際のデバイスの動作条件である連続光励起下でのキャリア特性とどのように関連しているかは議論されてきませんでした。
		  本論文で我々は、シンプルな解析手法を提案し、パルス励起の実験結果から太陽光照射下・定常状態でのキャリア挙動を予測できることを示しました。
		  具体的には、パルス励起下で得たキャリア寿命の実験値から、連続1sun照射下での定常キャリア寿命・密度、発光効率、開放電圧損失を見積もりました。
		  基礎物性の評価とデバイス性能の理解の直接的な懸け橋になればと思っています。
